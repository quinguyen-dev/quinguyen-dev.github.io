                    <h1>about</h1>
                    <p>
                        I began programming during my senior year of high school
                        after the last developer on my robotics team graduated.
                        At that time, I (as lead engineer) would have not
                        thought at that covering one role would turn into a
                        passion for another craft.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently working on building my software
                        engineering skills through agile-based work. I have
                        proudly developed for Brigham & Women's Hospital, as
                        well as Polar Park and the Worcester Red Sox.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of programming, I am an avid music enjoyer,
                        enjoy reading manga, and love playing games with my
                        friends.
